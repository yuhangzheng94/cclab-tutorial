## Motivation 
Hi! This is Yuhang. I have served as Learning Assistant for Creative Coding Lab for two semesters and Interaction Lab for a semester. Over the years students (and I) have run into similar problems when they try to make mini games with multiple levels or interactive stories with multiple scenes in p5.js/Processing, such as “How do I move to the next scene?” So I decided to make a tutorial on how I approach this problem from scratch, and I hope it helps!

## Objectives
Upon completion of this tutorials, students will:
Review techniques about key/mouse interaction, collision detection, and Object-Oriented Programming,
Be able to use global variables and if statements for scene management, and 
Cultivate algorithmic thinking, and understand why we decouple states (update) and their representation (display).

## Step 1: Create a single level

### 1.1 Use LA Jason’s tutorial to create a scene with balls bouncing within the sketch.
Code available here: https://editor.p5js.org/ztothey2dah/sketches/xsLD3Csyq

### 1.2 Add mouse interaction so that it disappears upon click.

## Step 2: Insert “Start” and “All Clear” pages

### 2.1 Build a prototype for scene management using global variables and if statements

### 2.2 Incorporate the prototype with our game.

## Step 3: Expand the game to multiple levels!

## Step 4 (advanced): Add timer and HP to the game

BUT (there’s always a but) don’t let this practice hold back your imagination and creativity!
